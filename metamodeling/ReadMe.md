# Metamodeling with SIPPY

Find SIPPY here: https://github.com/CPCLAB-UNIPI/SIPPY.git

## Work in progress

- find out why the model prediction is almost perfect, but shifted by approx. -20Â°C.
- add forward stepwise model selection
- add license, reference, etc. for SIPPY, as it is not installable with pip and we copied the source in ./resources
