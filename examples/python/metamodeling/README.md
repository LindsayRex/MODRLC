# Metamodeling with SIPPY (N4SID and Lasso Regression)

This directory contains the scripts to generate the metamodels
needed for the MPC planning model and the RL training model. The
metamodels run much faster than a full modelica simulation and
allow for rapid exploration of the model parameter space.

Find SIPPY here: https://github.com/CPCLAB-UNIPI/SIPPY.git

## Running Instructions

The setup is self-contained and afeter installing the python 
dependencies using Poetry `pip install poetry; poetry install`,
the user can simply run the block below to retrain the metamodels.

```bash
python SOM.py
```
## Work in progress

- find out why the model prediction is almost perfect, but shifted by approx. -20Â°C.
- add forward stepwise model selection
- add license, reference, etc. for SIPPY, as it is not installable with pip and we copied the source in ./resources
