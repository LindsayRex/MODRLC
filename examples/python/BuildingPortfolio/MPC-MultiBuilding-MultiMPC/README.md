# dompc examples

This folder contains an implementation of the do-mpc project and some of the example projects from the
do-mpc project repository. 

To run the MPC problem that is contained in this folder, do the following.

* In the [python folder](../) (on up from this one), install the dependencies using Poetry. The instructions are
  in that folder's [REAMDE file](../../README.md).

* In a seperate terminal launch the testcase from the project checkout base directory. The `spawnrefsmalloffice` model is the only one that this controller has been tested with.
  * `make run`
  
* Run the `main.py` file in this folder. 

  ```bash
  python main.py  
  ```
